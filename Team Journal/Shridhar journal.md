1. What tasks did I work on / complete?  
Explored various games to be designed on Greenfoot, came up with shooting rocket game in which enemies collide with the rocket and rocket has to defend itself from the enemies by shooting them.  

2. What am I planning to work on next?  
Before the next scrum meeting I need to have clear understanding of how this tool works and its functionalities. Discuss the nuances in the game as well as the use of Greenfoot. I have to properly understand the original game and apply the state pattern inside it.
3. What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?  
Every member needs to do same task for initial week. All are working in parallel so no blocking on another member as we have modularized the work independently.
